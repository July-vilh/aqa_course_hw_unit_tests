A collection of assignments completed during an Automated Quality Assurance (AQA) course, focusing on core JavaScript & TypeScript concepts such as variables, control structures, functions, arrays, objects, OOP, async programming, and code quality tools. This project helped me establish a strong foundation in these languages, which I now apply to writing automated tests, ensuring clean and maintainable code in test scripts.
